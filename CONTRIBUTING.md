## How to contribute to twodsix

Make an issue if you have ideas or have found bugs, or a pull request if you have code or documentation.

## To contribute translations
Either send in a completed translation file for your language (e.g. by copying en.json to xx.json, and translating only the text to the right of the colon for each line), or if you are comfortable with it, do as per below, making sure to also add your system to "languages" in system.json before you do the Pull Request.

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

## How to set up for development
1. Fork project in github
1. Clone project to your local working directory
1. Do one of the following: 
    1. Copy the file foundryconfig.example.json to foundryconfig.json and edit the new file to point to the appropriate directory.
        1. Windows example of foundryconfig.json contents:
        ```
        {
        "dataPath": "C:\\Users\\jk\\AppData\\Local\\FoundryVTT",
        "systemName": "twodsix"
        }
       ```
        1. TODO: Mac/unix example not verified to work:
        ```
        {
        "dataPath": "/Users/shammond/Library/Application Support/FoundryVTT",
        "systemName": "twodsix"
        }
        ```
    1. Symlink dist directory to your Foundry data directory.
        1. Mac/unix example:
        ```
        ln -s /Users/shammond/Projects/FoundryVTT/twodsix-foundryvtt/dist "/Users/shammond/Library/Application Support/FoundryVTT/Data/systems/twodsix"
        ```
        1. Windows example (add /h to mklink to get a hard link rather than a soft link):
        ```
        mklink /d C:\Users\jk\foundryvtt\twodsix\dist C:\Users\jk\AppData\Local\FoundryVTT\Data\systems\twodsix
        ```
1. Do the following each time you have updated your fork and want to test your code:
    1. Builds the prerequisites
       `npm install`
    1. Runs the system in 'developer mode', watching for changes in the code as they happen
       `npm run build:dev`
1. When you are done, create a Pull Request as per the section above this.

* Depending on your editor/IDE you may have to install a plugin/integration for editconfig to be supported (the builds will complain if you don't format the code according to the rules set up there). See https://editorconfig.org/ for details and where to find that for your editor/IDE.

* You may also need a plugin/integration to support eslint, for pretty much the same reasons. See https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations for where to find that  for your editor/IDE. (Though, you can of course run eslint manually before committing if you prefer.)
